        <h2>Facts</h2>
        <p>It was revealed in the first season that Murdock and B.A. share the same blood type AB negative, the rarest type.<br>
<br>
Murdock has extensive knowledge of various subjects and keeps up on current events, showing a genius-level aptitude. He speaks several languages including Spanish, German, Vietnamese, Japanese, Russian (not too well though) and Mandarin Chinese.<br>
<br>
It is never made clear if Murdock truly is insane or only exceptionally good at pretending he is (or a combination of the two). He is stated as having paranoid anxiety, delusions, and intermittent memory loss.<br>
<br>
Murdock is almost always seen in a ball cap, a customized A-2 leather flight jacket with a picture of a tiger and the words "Da Nang 1970" on the back, a pair of khaki pants, and a pair of black Converse sneakers. He also often wears a t-shirt with a comical caption or a picture of cartoon characters like The Jetsons on it.<br></p>
        <h2>Abilities</h2>
          <p>Murdock's primary role in the team is as a pilot. He claims that he can fly anything with wings, and this seems to be borne out by the show. He can also drive a semi [2], and operate construction equipment (such as a crane[3] and tractor[4]) and a jet refueling truck[5]. Though he doesn't usually drive the team around, when it's necessary he can be very skilled at evading pursuit.[6] In addition to flying and driving, Murdock is capable of piloting a sailboat.[7] He knows how to ride a horse,[8] parachute,[9] and SCUBA dive[10] (in spite of B.A.'s claim that Murdock couldn't swim.[11]). He can pick a lock (though not as well as Face can).<br>
